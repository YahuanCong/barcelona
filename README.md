  I Believe I Can Fly
" I used to think that I could not go on
  And life was nothing but an awful song
  But now I know the meaning of true love
  I'm leaning on the everlasting arms
  If I can see it, then I can do it
  If I just believe it
  There's nothing to it
  I believe I can fly
  I believe I can touch the sky
  I think about it every night and day
  Spread my wings and fly away
  I believe I can soar
  I see me running through that open door
  I believe I can fly
  See I was on the verge of breaking down
  Sometimes silence can seem so loud
  There are miracles in life I must achieve
  But first I know
  It starts inside of me, oh
  If I can see it
  Then I can be it
  If I just believe it
  There's nothing to it "
